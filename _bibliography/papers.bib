  title={Decision-aid or Controller? Steering Human Decision Makers with Algorithms},
  abstract={Algorithms are used to aid human decision makers by making predictions and recommending decisions. Currently, these algorithms are trained to optimize prediction accuracy. What if they were optimized to control final decisions? In this paper, we study a decision-aid algorithm that learns about the human decision maker and provides ``personalized recommendations'' to influence final decisions. We first consider fixed human decision functions which map observable features and the algorithm's recommendations to final decisions. We characterize the conditions under which perfect control over final decisions is attainable. Under fairly general assumptions, the parameters of the human decision function can be identified from past interactions between the algorithm and the human decision maker, even when the algorithm was constrained to make truthful recommendations. We then consider a decision maker who is aware of the algorithm's manipulation and responds strategically. By posing the setting as a variation of the cheap talk game [Crawford and Sobel, 1982], we show that all equilibria are partition equilibria where only coarse information is shared: the algorithm recommends an interval containing the ideal decision. We discuss the potential applications of such algorithms and their social implications.},

  title={Persuasion, Delegation, and Private Information},
  abstract={I combine two central questions in information design -- persuasion and delegation. I study a setting with two-sided private information and a general form of preference misalignment. The principal and agent have access to a common set of actions, and share a prior across an unknown state of the world. The action impacts the welfare of both players. The principal designs an information structure that generates a publicly observable signal. After observing the signal realization, the principal decides whether to delegate the action choice or to choose herself. The agent observes a private signal, and if the decision is delegated, must choose the action. I first characterize the optimal delegation rule, conditional on a signal realization. In particular, the principal strictly prefers delegation if and only if the agent's potential posteriors fall on both sides of the ``disagreement interval.'' Then, I derive the optimal public information structure when delegation is available. These results have important implications for the design of assisted decisions, where for example, algorithms may provide recommendations to and restrict the actions of human experts, who have private information but may be biased. Our results suggest that human-in-the-loop is desirable only if the value of human's private information exceeds the cost of disagreement. Additionally, providing biased humans with accurate recommendations may not be optimal.},

  title={Do High Stakes Muddle the Information From Standardized Tests? Evidence From Brazil's ENEM Exam},
  abstract={This paper evaluates two criticisms of high-stakes college admission exams: 1) High-stakes exams help wealthy students ``game the system'' through test prep; and 2) This gaming creates ``bias'' in scores in the sense that it is not informative about academic potential. Our empirical analysis exploits the introduction of a national standardized admission exam in Brazil called the ENEM. The staggered adoption of the ENEM by selective universities meant that high school seniors took either a low-stakes (from their perspective) school accountability test or a high-stakes exam that determined admission to top universities in their state, depending on their location and cohort. We find that test score gaps between high- and lower-income students expanded when selective universities adopted the ENEM in admissions, but the increase in exam stakes also made ENEM scores more informative for students' college outcomes. Our results show that high-stakes admission exams increase socioeconomic inequality in access to selective colleges, but they also help universities identify students who are likely to succeed academically.},

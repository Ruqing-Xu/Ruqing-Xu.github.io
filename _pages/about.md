I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Cornell University. 

My research is at the intersection of Economics and Computer Science. In particular, I study the role of information in decision-making, and how to design systems that incorporate both human and algorithmic assessments. I am a member of Cornell's initiative on [Artificial Intelligence, Policy, and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) (AIPP).

Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Hong Kong with First Class Honours in Comparative Literature and Economics. I also spent a wonderful year at Yale University via the [Y-VISP](https://yvisp.yale.edu/) program. 

My real world interests include horseback riding and astrophotography. View some of my works [here](/life/). 

My CV is available [here](/cv/). You can reach me at rx24@cornell.edu.

How to pronounce my name? <em>Roo-ching Shee</em>.

<!-- 
I am Ruqing Xu (Ru is pronounced like "rou" in "routine" and qing like "ching"). 
"Roo-ching shee"
In particular, I study the role of (algorithmic) information in (human) decision-making and the best way of designing information to achieve socially optimal outcomes.

My recent works engage with this problem from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.
